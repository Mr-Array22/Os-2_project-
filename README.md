The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic synchronization problem in operating systems.

The problem is defined as follows: there is a fixed-size buffer and a Producer process, and a Consumer process.

The Producer process creates an item and adds it to the shared buffer. The Consumer process takes items out of the shared buffer and “consumes” them.
